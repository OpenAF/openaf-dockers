    Title: 'org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http: jetty: Jetty URI parsing of invalid authority'
    Description: |-
      Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.

      The HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI
       differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be 
      considered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI
       and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an 
      invalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may
       be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI 
      is used after passing validation checks.
